This is the solution for lab 1

sim.py is the main source code. The other codes are just for testing 

For random packet generation, run sim.py by giving it two arguments, 1st one for the number of pkts needed to be simulated and second for the value of lambda

eg. python sim.py 10000 1

For running the trace files trace.txt and trace2.txt,
run: python sim.py trace.txt
or   python sim.py trace2.txt
